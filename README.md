# GPRO App API Documentation for Public Release

## Overview
This project provides the OpenAPI definition for GPRO's App API, aiming to offer a user-friendly, secure, and well-structured API documentation, curating endpoints that are of interest to GPRO players for their gameplay data collection.

## Development
* **Project Definition and Research:** I initiated and proposed the idea for the API documentation project to stakeholders, considering users' needs and security concerns. I acquired in-depth knowledge of the OpenAPI standard specifically for this project and developed the initial API documentation and also conducted a thorough research and evaluation of documentation frameworks, comparing Swagger and ReDoc, and ultimately selected ReDoc for its enhanced features and seamless integration capabilities.
* **Implementation and Current State:** I conducted comprehensive testing of the API's v1 to ensure usability and functionality. Later, I curated and selected endpoints for the public release, prioritizing users' desired features. I evaluated the initial API implementation and proposed necessary changes, collaborating closely with the development team to implement these improvements. Finlly, I configured and deployed the pre-Beta v2 of the API documentation on a remote server, ensuring accessibility and stability for further testing and feedback. Currently, I'm actively contributing on the project, updating the documentation and collecting user's feedback.

## Documentation
The documentation is available in [ReDoc Framework](https://api.gpro.net/) format. Alternatively, the OpenAPI definition can be downloaded from [GPRO's server](https://api.gpro.net/gpro-public-api.yml), which is synchronized with this repository.

## Feedback and Contributions
I'm actively seeking feedback to improve the API documentation further. If you are a GPRO player and encounter any issues, think a useful endpoint is missing or have other suggestions, please reach out via the [GPRO Forum](https://gpro.net/forum/ViewTopic.asp?TopicId=32017#scroll).
